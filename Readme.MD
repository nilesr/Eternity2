## Eternity, but useable

Imagine my surprise when I tried to use [Eternity](https://github.com/EZ3CHI3L/Eternity), my [window to the good](https://u.nya.is/zcdfzn.png), only to find out that attempting to compile it leads to a [2000+ line error message](http://i.imgur.com/aYBpc2P.png).

I just rewrote it in python

Click to dismiss. Most window managers let you drag the window around by holding alt and clicking and dragging, or by pressing a keyboard combination.

Depends on pygame
